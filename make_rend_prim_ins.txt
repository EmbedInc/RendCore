                        Program MAKE_REND_PRIM_INS
                              31 August 2019

make_rend_prim_ins <input file name>

This program is run as part of the build process for a RENDlib graphics
primitive.  The input file is the Pascal source module for that primitive.

Each RENDlib primitive has a REND_PRIM_DATA_T (defined in REND.INS.PAS)
data structure associated with it.  This program writes the include file
that defines this data structure for the primitive being built.

The purpose of the data structure is to ultimately indicate what use, if
any, this primitive makes of the software bitmap.  This information can be
used, for example, to force other primitives to use the software bitmap
instead of directly driving rendering hardware.

Each data structure indicates how, if at all, this primitive accesses the
software bitmap directly, and what other primitives it calls.  This
program determines this information implicitly by looking for calls thru
the REND_PRIM, REND_SW_PRIM, REND_INTERNAL, and REND_SW_INTERNAL call
tables.  The primitive name is taken from the MODULE statement.

This program also takes information from explicit commands in the source
module.  These commands are intended to be in comments to the compiler.
Each such command line must start with exactly "* PRIM_DATA ", followed by
the command name and any command parameters.  Starting with the command
name, keywords are case-insensitive.  The commands are:

  SW_READ YES|NO|INHERITED

    Indicates whether this primitive directly reads from the software
    bitmap.  If it does not, but calls other primitives, then this
    property should be set to INHERITED.  That indicates the read access
    to the sofware bitmap depends implicitly on other primitives called by
    this primitive.

  SW_WRITE YES|NO|INHERITED

    Same as SW_READ, but applies to writing to the software bitmap instead
    of reading from it.

  PRIM_CALL name

    Explicitly indicates that the primitive NAME is called by this
    primitive.

  PRIM_DATA_P pointer

    Explicitly indicates that the primitive whos REND_PRIM_DATA_T
    structure is at POINTER is called by this primitive.


Output File

  The output file is the name of the primitive as defined in the MODULE
  statement, followed by "_d.ins.pas".  For example, the source module
  "rend_sw_disc_2dim.pas" contains the primitive "rend_sw_disc_2dim".  The
  command:

    make_rend_prim_ins rend_sw_disc_2dim.pas

  will produce the output file "rend_sw_disc_2dim_d.ins.pas", which will
  define the data structure "rend_sw_disc_2dim_d".
