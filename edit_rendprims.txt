edit_rendprims

Scan all the .pas files in the current directory, identify which are
RENDlib graphics primites, and possibly edit them.  Output files are also
created:

  PRIM_LIST.TXT  -  List of all the graphics primitives found.  The names
    are from the MODULE statements.

  NPRIM_LIST.TXT  -  List of all modules (not programs), that are not
    graphics primitives.

  NMOD_LIST.TXT  -  List of .pas source files that contained no MODULE
    statement.

RENDlib graphics primitive modules are identified in two ways:

  1 - A line is found starting with

      %include '$(REND_PRIM_INS)';

    This is the "old" style used in the DSEE build system.  If found, it
    is changed to the new style according to point 2, below.

  2 - A line is found starting with

      %include 'xxx_d.ins.pas';

    where XXX is the module name as given in the MODULE statement.

  A MODULE statement is required for a source file to be considered a
  RENDlib graphics primitive.

This program is intended to convert graphics primitive source modules from
the old style to the new style.  It does no harm to modules that are
already in the new style.  The program can also be useful to identify the
graphics primitives among the various source modules in a directory.
